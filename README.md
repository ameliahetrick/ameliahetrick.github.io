**[Goodshelf](https://ameliahetrick.github.io/goodshelf) | Goodreads bookshelf** - Visual reading log of recent years; imports data from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) widgets (*grid* & *reading challenge*).

**[colorJumper](https://ameliahetrick.github.io/colorJumper) | Inspired by color mixers** - takes two color inputs - *initial* and *midpoint* - and returns a *result* such that *initial* and *result* are equidistant to *midpoint*.
- color mixers: (:red_square: **red**, :blue_square: **blue**) &rarr; :purple_square: **purple**
- colorJumper: (:red_square: **red**, :purple_square: **purple**) &rarr; :blue_square: **blue**
