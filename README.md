**[Goodshelf](https://ameliahetrick.github.io/goodshelf) \| Goodreads bookshelf** - visual reading log of recent years; imports data from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) widgets (*grid* & *reading challenge*).

**[colorJumper](https://ameliahetrick.github.io/colorJumper) \| Inspired by color mixers** - takes two input colors *initial*  and *midpoint*; returns *result* such that *initial* and *result* are equidistant to *midpoint*.
- color mixers: ( :red_square: **red**, :blue_square: **blue** ) &rarr; :purple_square: **purple**
- colorJumper: ( :red_square: **red**, :purple_square: **purple** ) &rarr; :blue_square: **blue**
